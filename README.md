# About
The best outdoor city deserves the best outdoor recreation map. This project is part of a broader effort to build an open outdoor recreation map that any one can use on their website or mobile application. To learn more about this effort visit our [project page](http://openchattanooga.com/chamap/) or just jump right in and start contributing in this [github repo](https://github.com/openchattanooga/chamap). 

Chattanooga has some of the best design talent around. This project is opening up the design of the open outdoor recreation map to the community. See below on how to contribute to the style!
